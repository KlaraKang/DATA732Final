      <h1>20 Years of U.S. Hate Crimes</h1>
      <h2> Data visualizations of U.S. hate crimes occurred between 2001 and 2020. </h2> <br>

    <div class="padded">
      <p style="color:rgb(10, 64, 64);font-size: 16px;"> <b>Topics covered:</b><br>
        1) Hate crime volume across the U.S. states per year.<br>
        2) Changes of the incident volume over the 20 years per state.<br>
        3) Incident volume for each different bias type per year. <br>
        4) Distribution of the crimes by the offense types over the 20 years. <br>
        5) Hate crime volume for each different victim type per year.<br>
        6) Hierarchy of the place types where the crimes had occurred the most.<br><br> 
        <b>Goals:</b>
        By visualizing 20 years of the hate crime data for each of these topics, 
        I would like to find patterns of the incident, such as when the hate crimes occurred the most, 
        where these crimes took place, who the victims were, how the crimes were motivated, 
        and how the crimes were carried out.<br><br>

        The Hate Crime Statistics dataset (Years: 1991-2020, File size: 4.57MB, Last modified: Oct.25, 2021) <br>

	<b>About the dataset and data preparations:</b><br>
	The dataset includes the number of incidents, offenses, victims, and location types in reported crimes between 1991 and 2020 
	that are motivated in whole, or in part, by an offender’s bias against the victim’s perceived race, gender, gender identity, 
	religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity. According to the data source website, this data are captured by 
	indicating the element of bias present in offenses already being reported to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program 
	and contributed by all law enforcement agencies, whether they submit Summary Reporting System (SRS) or National Incident-Based
	Reporting System (NIBRS) reports.<br><br>

	For this data visualization project, I only included the records reported between 2001 and 2020, with a total of 145,847 hate 
	crime incidents against 180,925 victims. <br>	
	Each incident can be reported with up to five bias motivations, and 4.5% of all biase types are multi-biased (6,494/145,847), 
  1.7% of all victim types consist of multiple victim types (2,478/145,847), 3.2% of all offense types consist of multiple offense types (4,684/145,847), 
  and 4.7% of all location types include multiple location types (6,852/145,847).<br><br>

	<b>The total victim counts</b> are visualized using the US map and line chart in Part I and II below. <br>
	<b>The total incident counts</b> are visualized for different types of motivation, victim, offense, and location in Part III to VI.<br>
	For Part III to VI, I have generated new datasetsethat split multiple biases into multiple rows to 
	ensure every incident types are included in the visualization.<br><br>

	  
	<br><b>Definition</b><br>
	The term <b>victim</b> may refer to an individual, business/financial institution, government entity, religious organization, or society/public as a whole.<br>
	A <b>multiple-bias</b> incident is an incident in which one or more offense types are motivated by two or more biases.
